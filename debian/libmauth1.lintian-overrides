# Debian policies for packaging changed in stretch. Maintscripts do not have to
# call ldconfig anymore and linitian will print a maintscript-calls-ldconfig
# warning about it.
#
# To be compatible with jessie and stretch, we'll use the stretch behaviour here
# and manually add the triggers, which are created by debhelper in stretch. The
# postinst-must-call-ldconfig will be ignored.

\section{Requirements}

The main focus is on \ul{data authenticity and integrety}. Otherwise one could
simply give himself privileged access. Even third party could get access via
MITM\footnote{\textbf{M}an \textbf{I}n \textbf{T}he \textbf{M}iddle} attacks, if
the data could be manipulated. \\

A second focus should be on \ul{simplicity}. The toolset should be easy to use,
otherwise there is no benefit on using mauth. Every employee should use the same
account accross all machines without the need to maintain the accounts
independent per machine. \\

In addition to this, the configuration at the customers' side should be simple.
A new server should be integrated into the network in a couple of minutes.

\section{Requirements}

The following requirements should be met:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data initegrity and authenticity must be ensured. Otherwise one could
		simply give himself sudo rights. Even third party could get access via
		MITM\footnote{\textbf{M}an \textbf{I}n \textbf{T}he \textbf{M}iddle}
		attacks, if the data could be manipulated.
	\item Not every server should be configured by hand. This is time consuming
		and annoying. The system should find its configuration automaticaly, but
		it must be authenticated.
	\item Only one account should be used per employee.
	\item Several authentication servers should be able to be joined. In some
		special cases you have e.g. one company which maintains the network and
		another for some of the servers. The last one may need e.g. an SSH
		tunnel or access to nagios, etc.
\end{itemize}

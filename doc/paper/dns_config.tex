\section{Configuration via DNS}

\textit{Read this section \ul{carefuly before implementing} this in your
network. It may cause a huge vulnerability if used in wrong environments!} \\

To decrease maintenance overhead, the API proxy may be found via
NAPTR\footnote{NAPTR resource record is defined in
\href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2915}{RFC 2915}} DNS resource records for
the service \verb+staffauth+ in one of the local search-domains of the calling
machine, to deploy the domain name of the API proxy: \\

\begin{lstlisting}[language=none, numbers=none]
staffauth.example.com.  IN  NAPTR  100  10  "A"  ""  ""  saprox.example.com.
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{0.5cm}

Unlike HTTPS plain DNS \ul{has no builtin authenticity checks}. Use this
configuration method only, if you can ensure that no third party is able to
manipulate your network or if your DNS records are secured by DNSSEC and your
resolver checks these records carefuly.

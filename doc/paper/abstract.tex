\section*{Abstract}

staffAuth is a concept and a set of tools to authenticate maintenance employees
at mainly Linux based machines and other services at customers' side. It should
help to keep the employees' accounts synchronized on all machines without the
need to do this by hand or to send huge data packets on any change.

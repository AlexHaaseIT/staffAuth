\section*{Abstract}

mauth is a concept and a set of tools to authenticate maintenance employees at
mainly Linux based machines and other services at customers' side. It should
help to keep the employees' accounts synchronized across all machines without
the need to do this by hand or deploy huge data packets for each modification.
\\

\textit{\textbf{WARNING}: This is a concept! It might be good and practicable,
but it is not a guaranty that it is the best neither that it is the most
secure.}
